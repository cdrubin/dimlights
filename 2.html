## passwords are going to be around for a bit

- most existing well-maintained sites still offer email/password logins. ([airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/signup_login) offers many authentication options, email and password are still present)
- websites without active development teams will offer email/password for the foreseeable future. (small organizations, community sites, ...)
- keeping those passwords safe is fraught and difficult across devices

## scratching my own itch

- i currently use an encrypted text file and copy-paste - i want to do better
- reduce dependencies on a third-parties for this service if possible
- copy-paste is more insecure than i thought!
- browser extensions seem like a ___weak___ link in the chain
- could i run this kind of service myself and administer it for use by my family?

## architecture (Alice is client, Bob is server)

An OPAQUE credential file is created for each user using an OPAQUE register flow and stored in KV for general authentication
and listing of the credentials (in the diagram below: Gmail, Amazon,...) saved by that user.

![OPAQUE register](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/232306/167722486-0672fbbc-abb2-4a79-9e49-e6595ff0090b.png)

## architecture (Alice is client, Bob is server)

Each credential stored by a user is another OPAQUE register flow followed by an OPAQUE auth flow during which the user 
AES encrypts their secret using the stable __export_key__ resulting from auth and transmits 
that blob using the __session_key__ that server and client share per auth exchange. By convention, sending a data blob during auth stores 
that encrypted data and not sending one retrieves the existing encrypted data.

![OPAQUE auth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/232306/167722592-348965aa-2ed3-49b2-a685-21c8b1335efd.png)

## architecture (data store)

Workers KV contains entries like the following:

```json
{ key: "my@email.com", data: "", 
  metadata: { 
    credential_file: "<OPAQUE credential file>", url: "" 
  } 
}
```
which are used for general authentication (and used when returning a list of KV key prefixes for a user to populate the credential list). 

An entry is also present <u>per saved credential</u> with key ```"<identity>:<name>:(identifier)"```. These contain the 
encrypted secret data and may optionally include a ___url___ that can be used for navigating to the site for that credential:
```json

{ key: "my@email.com:Gmail:gmail_identifier", data: "<AES encryped blob>", 
  metadata: { 
    credential_file: "<OPAQUE credential file>", 
    url: "https://accounts.google.com" }
  } 
}
```

## architecture (client behaviour)
      
- the ___passcake___ webpage intends to operate like a list of bookmarks (for those credentials that include a URL)
- when a link is clicked the identifier value (for those credentials that include one) is copied to the clipboard before the URL is opened in a new window
- to avoid copying sensitive data to the clipboard passwords can be sent using the browser postMessage API from the passcake page to windows that it has opened 
- a postMessage listener is registed on the receiving window, user returns to the passcake window and then a message with password is sent to the receiver

      ### ...passwords a piece of cake ...passcake ...pass-the-cake ...OPAQUE ...pake ...cake ...mmmm.
      
---
## demonstration (registration)
      
- register by creating a credential file for the user (OPAQUE register)
- save the new homepage as a bookmark
- copy and save the passcake bookmarklet as a bookmark

## demonstration (add a credential)

- enter OPAQUE password and authenticate (OPAQUE auth) to return list of existing saved credentials
- submitting entered credential details first creates a new OPAQUE __credential file__ for the user (OPAQUE register) with KV key that includes name and optionally an identifier (username/email) and url
- then clien authenticates against the new credential (OPAQUE auth init) which returns _session_key_ and _export_key_ to client
- client AES encrypts their secret with _export_key_, then AES re-encrypts with _session_key_ and sends to server during OPAQUE auth finish
- server decrypts data with _session_key_ and stores AES encrypted secret with the OPAQUE __credential file__ for that key

## demonstration (use a credential)

- enter OPAQUE password and authenticate (OPAQUE auth) which returns list of existing saved credentials
- click on item client copies identifier to the clipboard for ease of use
- on opened page paste the identifier, progress to password field
- click bookmarklet, select target field for password entry
- postMessage listener created (and visual mark added)
- return to passcake tab and click 'passcake' button 
- OPAQUE authenticate to credential to retrieve stored secret and use _export_key_ to decrypt
- postMessage secret to opened window
- opened window captures message containing password and enters value in field

## potential uses and future work

- bring back the idea of setting a browser "home page" (that is not a search box!)
- add icons for browser health (to indicate things like "are my DNS queries private?") so this information is always visible
- allow deletion and editing of credentials
- make user interface more attractive
- get touch bookmarklet to work right for mobile
- improve mouse bookmarklet
